        ## 👋 Welcome to the CNCF Content Generator!
        
        This template will automatically generate publication-ready content from a YouTube video.
        
        **What can be generated:**
        - 📄 **Case Study** (500-1500 words, 5 sections, business-focused)
        - 🏗️ **Reference Architecture** (2000-5000 words, 13 sections, technical-focused)
        - 📦 **Both** (dual content for different audiences)
        
        **Requirements:**
        - ✅ Video should be from CNCF events (KubeCon, meetups, etc.)
        - ✅ Video should contain technical details about CNCF project usage
        - ✅ Company featured is preferably a CNCF member
