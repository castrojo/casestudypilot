## Why These Are Archived

The casestudypilot system is now **production-ready (v2.2.0)** with:
- ✅ All 11 CLI commands implemented and working
- ✅ Agent workflow complete with fail-fast validation
- ✅ 3 agent skills documented and operational
- ✅ Screenshot integration fully functional
- ✅ 2 successful case studies generated

These documents served their purpose during development but are no longer needed for day-to-day operations. For current documentation, see:

- **Main README:** `/README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- **Agent Workflow:** `/.github/agents/case-study-agent.md` (v2.2.0) - Current workflow
- **Agent Skills:** `/.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` - Current skills
- **Maintenance Guide:** `/docs/MAINTENANCE.md` - How to maintain and extend the system

## Historical Value

These documents remain valuable for:
- Understanding the evolution of the project
- Learning about design decisions and trade-offs
- Reference during major refactoring or redesign
- Training new contributors on the project's history
